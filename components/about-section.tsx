                Rodriw Castel is a South American artist born in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, in 2002. He creates music in English, 
                drawing inspiration from artists like Beyonc√©, Janet Jackson, Bj√∂rk, Etta James, and Michael Jackson.

                and finding his voice in a world full of noise.

                His first single, ‚ÄúMelting Water,‚Äù was released on November 22, 2022. The song talks about love as a 
                powerful force that brings comfort during hard times. It marked the beginning of Rodriw‚Äôs musical path, 
                offering listeners a deep and emotional experience. 
                Later, on December 10, 2024, he released ‚ÄúHey, There is Always a Kind of Day ‚Äì Special Version,‚Äù inspired by
                a power outage during a storm. The track is about holding onto hope when everything around you seems to fall apart.

                <strong className="text-white font-semibold">Rodriw‚Äôs newest single,</strong> ‚ÄúBill and Victoria,‚Äù 
                will be released on May 1, 2025. It tells the story of a magical, one-night connection at a house party with a girl 
                named Victoria‚Äîa name used to protect her real identity. The moment may have been brief, but it left a strong impact, 
                showing how one person can shine brighter than everyone else. As Rodriw sings: ‚ÄúAll of the girls in my place, they'll
                come to the break of day, [...] they can't compare with Victoria, in one of her best days.‚Äù
